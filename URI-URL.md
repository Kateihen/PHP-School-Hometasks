A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that identifies a particular resource and can be 
classified as a name, a locator, or both. There are two basic types of URI - names by themselves (Uniform Resource Name, URN),
and names that include how to get to them (Uniform Resource Locator, URL). The part that makes something a URL 
is the combination of the name and an access method, since URL, in addition to just identifying a resource,
also provides a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism and network location. 
So, URL refers to the subset of URI, which means that all URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.
