<p>Web server is a server that receives incoming network request from a client, processes this request, and then delivers 
the result (the requested web page) to the client by using Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Reverse proxy server is a type 
of proxy server that receives an incoming request from a client, forwards this request to the associated server in the 
internal network, retrieves resources from this associated server, and then delivers the resources to the client
as if they originated from the proxy server itself.</p>
<p>The difference between web server and proxy server is that web server is the source of data delivered to the client,
while proxy server is an intermediary between its associated servers and clients, and it can affect the way the data requested 
by the clients is delivered (for example, proxy server can hide the existence and characteristics of an origin server or servers; 
distribute the load from incoming requests to several servers; optimize content by compressing it
in order to speed up loading times, etc).</p>
